We use UV to manage our Python environment.

The project uses the `.venv` directory to store the virtual environment.

To activate the virtual environment, run `source .venv/bin/activate`.

To deactivate the virtual environment, run `deactivate`.

Requirements files are in the `requirements.txt` and `requirements_test.txt` files.
