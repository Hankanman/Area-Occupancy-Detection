# AOD Run and Operate

## What this covers

Command anatomy and artifact conventions for actually operating this project: starting the devcontainer's Home Assistant instance and adding an area through the UI, the debug-logging recipe, where the SQLite database lives (real install vs. tests), the hourly analysis pipeline as an operational process (steps, log lines, failure/backoff), recorder-sync watermark mechanics, the Flask simulator, and the release / HACS / docs-deploy machinery.

## When NOT to use this

- Debugging *why a probability number is wrong* (math, priors, likelihoods, decay) → `aod-debugging-playbook` and `bayesian-occupancy-reference`. This skill gets you to a running system and tells you what the logs mean structurally; it does not interpret Bayesian output.
- Environment/toolchain setup problems (bootstrap fails, `uv sync` errors, Python/ruff version skew, three-uv-project layout) → `aod-build-and-env` owns that. This skill assumes the environment already works and focuses on *using* it.
- Deep diagnostics workflows (diagnostics.json field-by-field, `db/maintenance.py` integrity checks, `scripts/visualize_distributions.py`) → `aod-diagnostics-and-tooling`.
- Versioning and release *policy* (what may change, gates, the three-file bump rule, CalVer scheme) → `aod-change-control`. This skill only covers the mechanical commands to cut a release.

## 1. Devcontainer Home Assistant instance

The devcontainer config is `.devcontainer.json` at repo root (not a `.devcontainer/` folder — easy to look in the wrong place). It builds `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.13`, forwards port 8123, and runs `scripts/setup` (→ `scripts/bootstrap`) on create.

**Start Home Assistant:**

```bash
scripts/develop
```

This does three things: (1) creates `./config` via `uv run hass --config ./config --script ensure_config` if it doesn't exist yet, (2) sets `PYTHONPATH` to include `$PWD/custom_components` so `custom_components.area_occupancy` is importable without symlinking into HA's config dir, (3) runs `uv run hass --config ./config --debug`, piped through a colorizer (red=ERROR/CRITICAL, yellow=WARNING, green=INFO, dim=DEBUG). HA comes up at **http://localhost:8123**.

`config/configuration.yaml` is a hand-built minimal config (not `default_config:`, to avoid pulling every HA integration as a dependency). It already wires in `frontend`, `recorder`, `history`, `logbook`, debug logging for this integration (see §2), and a full synthetic sensor rig — one `input_boolean`/`input_select`/`input_number` plus a `template:` binary_sensor/sensor/cover per `InputType`, spread across 5 rooms (Living Room, Kitchen, Bathroom, Bedroom, Hallway), each exercising a different feature (full sensor suite, wasp-in-box, sleep/long-decay, minimal/short-decay passageway). You drive it by flipping those input helpers in **Developer Tools → Actions** or the dashboard — there is no real hardware in the loop.

**Install the integration into this instance:** it's already there — `custom_components/area_occupancy` is on `PYTHONPATH` via `scripts/develop`, so as soon as HA boots the integration is installable through the normal UI flow (no HACS needed inside the devcontainer).

**Add an area via the UI:**

1. Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → search "Area Occupancy Detection" (first time only; this is the `user` config-flow step).
2. You land in the "Add New Area" flow, which walks four steps in order: `area_basics` (name, purpose) → `area_motion` (motion sensors) → `area_sensors` (media/appliance/door/window/environmental sensors) → `area_behavior` (weights, decay, threshold) → finishes via `finish_setup`.
3. To add a *second* area to an already-configured integration entry: gear icon on the integration card → Configure → "Manage Areas" → "Add New Area" (same four-step flow, driven by the options flow's `async_step_add_area`).

Verified: `.devcontainer.json` (full contents), `scripts/develop`, `config/configuration.yaml` lines 1–40, `custom_components/area_occupancy/config_flow.py` (`async_step_area_basics`/`area_motion`/`area_sensors`/`area_behavior`/`add_area`/`manage_areas` step definitions), `custom_components/area_occupancy/strings.json` lines 12–18, 204–333.

For anything that goes wrong *setting up* this environment (bootstrap failures, uv sync errors, version skew) — that's `aod-build-and-env`, not here.

---

## 2. Debug logging recipe

The recipe is already live in the devcontainer's `config/configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: error
  logs:
    custom_components.area_occupancy: debug
```

For a real HA install, add this block to `configuration.yaml` and restart HA (no need to set `default: error` there — that's just to keep the devcontainer's own logs quiet). Logs land in **Settings → System → Logs** in the UI and, in the devcontainer, at `config/home-assistant.log` on disk.

The project's own `docs/docs/technical/debug.md` states an explicit operator order, which is worth following exactly because it's cheapest-first: **(1) download diagnostics** from the integration card's ⋮ menu — no config change needed, captures every prior/weight/evidence/decay/correlation/health value in one JSON file; **(2) check Settings → System → Repairs** for `sensor_health_*`/`pipeline_health_*` issues — a stuck or unavailable sensor is a common root cause and is surfaced automatically; **(3) only then** enable debug logging and reproduce live.

Verified: `config/configuration.yaml` lines 1–21; `docs/docs/technical/debug.md` (full file, "Diagnostics Export" / "Sensor Health Repairs" / "Debug Logging" sections).

---

## 3. Where the SQLite database lives

`DB_NAME = "area_occupancy.db"` (`const.py:265`). The path is always `<hass.config.config_dir>/.storage/area_occupancy.db`, computed in `AreaOccupancyDB._setup_paths()` (`db/core.py`). In the devcontainer that resolves to `config/.storage/area_occupancy.db` from repo root — confirmed present on disk with a `.db.backup` sibling (the periodic-backup mechanism in `db/maintenance.py` copies the file, after a WAL checkpoint, on a configurable interval). Engine: SQLAlchemy `sqlite:///{db_path}`, `NullPool`, `check_same_thread=False`, `timeout=10s`.

It's a normal SQLite3 file — inspect it directly with `sqlite3 config/.storage/area_occupancy.db` from repo root, or with `scripts/visualize_distributions.py --db-path <path>` for a matplotlib entry point. Reads are safe anytime; stop HA (or accept WAL-mode concurrent-read semantics) before writing directly.

**In tests**, there is no real file by default: the `db_engine` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` creates an **in-memory** SQLite engine (`sqlite:///:memory:?cache=shared`, `StaticPool`, `check_same_thread=False`) so state is visible across executor-thread connections within one test process. A separate helper, `setup_test_db_engine(db, db_path)`, exists for the minority of tests that need a real file-backed DB (e.g. testing backup/restore), pointed at a `tmp_path`-style path.

Verified: `custom_components/area_occupancy/const.py:265`; `custom_components/area_occupancy/db/core.py` `_setup_paths`/`_setup_engine`; `ls -la config/.storage/` (area_occupancy.db 966,656 bytes + area_occupancy.db.backup 516,096 bytes present); `db/maintenance.py` `_backup_database`/`periodic_health_check`; `tests/conftest.py` `db_engine` fixture and `setup_test_db_engine` helper.

---

## 4. The analysis pipeline as an operational process

`run_full_analysis()` in `data/analysis.py` runs on an hourly timer (see below) and orchestrates the whole learning loop. **On `main` at HEAD (2026.5.17) it is 12 steps.** Each step is wrapped by an inner `_run_step()` that times it, logs on success/failure, and — critically — **swallows the exception and continues to the next step** rather than aborting the whole run:

| # | Step name (as logged) | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `sync_states` | Pull recorder history since the last watermark (§5) |
| 2 | `health_check_and_prune` | DB integrity check + backup + prune intervals older than `RETENTION_DAYS` (365) |
| 3 | `sensor_health_check` | Per-entity anomaly detection → HA repair issues (skipped entirely if the integration-level `health_enabled` toggle is off) |
| 4 | `populate_occupied_intervals_cache` | Rebuild the motion-ground-truth cache, only if stale/invalid |
| 5 | `interval_aggregation` | Raw intervals → daily/weekly/monthly rollups |
| 6 | `numeric_aggregation` | Raw numeric samples → hourly/weekly rollups (feeds Gaussian correlation) |
| 7 | `recalculate_priors` | Per-area `PriorAnalyzer`: global prior + 168 (day-of-week × hour) time-priors |
| 8 | `correlation_analysis` | `db/correlation.py`: statistical sensor↔occupancy correlation, needs ≥`MIN_CORRELATION_SAMPLES` (50) |
| 9 | `pipeline_health_check` | Area-scope anomalies (no global prior after grace period, stale cache, slow analysis, high correlation-failure rate) → repair issues |
| 10 | `save_data_before_refresh` | Persist DB (preserves decay state ahead of the refresh) |
| 11 | `refresh_coordinator` | Recompute `probability()` for every area |
| 12 | `save_data_after_refresh` | Persist DB again |

Each step logs one of:

```
Step N: <step_name> completed in X.XX ms      # INFO, on success
Step N: <step_name> FAILED in X.XX ms          # ERROR (via _LOGGER.exception, includes traceback), on any exception
```

**What "Step N FAILED" means operationally:** that one step raised (any `Exception`), the pipeline logged it and moved on to step N+1 — a failure in `correlation_analysis` does not stop `pipeline_health_check` or the refresh from running. At the end of the run you get one summary line:

```
Analysis completed: S/12 steps succeeded (FAILED: step_a, step_b) in X.XX ms   # WARNING, if any step failed
Full analysis completed: 12/12 steps succeeded in X.XX ms                      # INFO, if all succeeded
```

If *any* step failed, `run_full_analysis` raises `HomeAssistantError` after the finally-block summary, which the coordinator's timer handler (`coordinator.run_analysis`) catches. **Backoff on failure: retry in 15 minutes** instead of the normal hourly cadence (`coordinator.py`, `run_analysis`: `next_update = _now + timedelta(minutes=15)` when `_failed`). On a clean run it reschedules for `analysis_interval` seconds later (`ANALYSIS_INTERVAL = 3600`, not currently exposed as a config-flow option — it's a fixed constant, not per-area).

Two shutdown-safety details worth knowing when reading logs: if HA starts shutting down mid-pipeline, remaining steps log `Step N: <name> skipped — shutdown in progress` (DEBUG) rather than FAILED, and the run's duration is deliberately **not** persisted (a fast, aborted run must not mask a previously-slow one in the health check's slow-analysis threshold). The **first** analysis run after HA (re)starts is deferred via `async_at_started` plus an additional fixed 5-minute delay, specifically so analysis never blocks HA's own bootstrap.

**Note on PR #454 (unmerged as of 2026-07-06 — verify with `gh pr view 454`):** the still-open "adjacent-areas" feature branch adds a 13th step, `transition_learning` (between correlation analysis and pipeline health check), for learning room-to-room transition probabilities. Do not describe a 13-step pipeline as current until that PR merges.

Verified directly: `custom_components/area_occupancy/data/analysis.py` (`git show main:...`) lines 35–235 (`run_full_analysis`, `_run_step`, docstring listing all 12 steps, the `total_steps = 12` literal, and every `_LOGGER` call); `custom_components/area_occupancy/coordinator.py` (`git show main:...`) `_start_analysis_timer`/`run_analysis` (5-minute post-boot defer, 15-minute failure backoff, `ANALYSIS_INTERVAL`); `custom_components/area_occupancy/const.py:286,306` (`MIN_CORRELATION_SAMPLES=50`, `ANALYSIS_INTERVAL=3600`); `gh pr view 454` (state OPEN as of 2026-07-06).

Two other always-on timers worth knowing about while reading logs: a **decay timer** (`DECAY_INTERVAL=10s`, `const.py:305`) ticks every area's decay and triggers a coordinator refresh if any area has decay enabled, and a **save timer** (`SAVE_INTERVAL=600s`, `const.py:307`) persists the DB every 10 minutes independent of the analysis pipeline.

---

## 5. Recorder sync mechanics (step 1)

`sync_states(db)` (`db/sync.py`) is the pipeline's step 1. It computes a time window and pulls HA recorder history for the union of every configured entity across all areas:

- `start_time = queries.get_latest_interval(db)` — a **single global watermark**, not per-entity/per-area: `SELECT max(end_time) FROM intervals`, minus a fixed **1-hour overlap** to re-catch any interval whose end time was still open when last synced.
- **First run** (empty/missing `intervals` table, or any `SQLAlchemyError`/`ValueError`/etc. reading it): the watermark defaults to `utcnow() - 10 days` — a 10-day backfill window.
- `end_time = dt_util.utcnow()`.
- States are fetched via HA's `get_significant_states(hass, start_time, end_time, entity_ids, minimal_response=False)`, converted to `Intervals` and `NumericSamples` rows, and committed in dedup-checked batches of 250.

If the recorder call raises (`SQLAlchemyError`, `HomeAssistantError`, `TimeoutError`, `OSError`, `RuntimeError` — e.g. a concurrent recorder purge), `sync_states` logs `"Failed to sync states: %s"` and re-raises as `HomeAssistantError`, which is exactly what produces `Step 1: sync_states FAILED` in the pipeline log. Because the watermark is global (not per-area), a sync failure blocks fresh interval data for **every** area that cycle, not just one.

Verified: `custom_components/area_occupancy/db/sync.py` (`git show main:...`) `sync_states` (lines ~301–366) and `custom_components/area_occupancy/db/queries.py` `get_latest_interval` (lines 42–66, including the 10-day and 1-hour constants).

---

## 6. The simulator

`simulator/app.py` is a **Flask** web app that lets you paste the YAML/dict output of the `area_occupancy.run_analysis` service and interactively toggle sensors to see probability recalculate live. It imports and calls the **real** `EntityType`/`Entity`/`Decay` classes from `custom_components.area_occupancy.data.*` — not a reimplementation of those data classes.

**Important nuance for anyone using it to sanity-check math:** the simulator's probability calculation calls `bayesian_probability()` from `utils.py` — the classic naive-Bayes log-odds accumulator. That function has **zero call sites in the live production coordinator/area path**, which since PR #353 (merged 2026-02-15) uses a sigmoid/logistic pipeline (`sigmoid_probability`/`presence_probability`/`environmental_confidence`/`combined_probability`) instead. So the simulator reproduces real `EntityType`/`Entity` state handling faithfully, but its probability *math* is the legacy formula, not what a running HA instance actually computes. If you need to verify the live sigmoid pipeline's output, this is not the tool — that's `aod-debugging-playbook` / `bayesian-occupancy-reference` territory.

**Run it locally:**

```bash
# one-time: install simulator deps into the shared .venv (this is what scripts/bootstrap does)
(cd simulator && uv sync --python ../.venv/bin/python)

# from repo root
python main.py
```

`main.py` at repo root imports `simulator.app:app` and runs it with `PORT` (default `5000`), `FLASK_DEBUG` (default `1`), `FLASK_HOST` (default `0.0.0.0`) env vars. `simulator/app.py` inserts the repo root onto `sys.path` itself, so `custom_components` imports work without any extra `PYTHONPATH` — unlike `scripts/develop`, no manual path wiring needed. Routes: `POST /api/analyze`, `POST /api/load`, `GET /api/get-purposes`.

Optionally pair it with a local docs preview (`cd docs && mkdocs serve`, open `http://localhost:8000/Area-Occupancy-Detection/simulator/`, point its "API Connection" field at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`).

**`simulator/README.md` is stale**: it instructs `pip install -r simulator/requirements.txt`, but no such file exists anywhere in the repo — `simulator/` is a `uv`/`pyproject.toml`-managed project (own `uv.lock`), so that line will fail as written. Use the `uv sync` command above instead.

**Docker / IBM Cloud deployment:** `simulator/Dockerfile` + `simulator/docker-compose.yml` build and run the same Flask app for container deployment (default port `10000` in that path, vs. `5000` via `main.py` locally — two different defaults, don't be surprised). `simulator/README.md` documents a manual `ibmcloud cr` push flow to IBM Cloud Container Registry.

**The docs site's interactive simulator is a thin client, not a local server.** `docs/docs/assets/simulator/app.js` hardcodes a production backend URL:

```js
const DEFAULT_API_BASE_URL = "https://area-occupancy-simulator.23ffgm1eszu1.eu-gb.codeengine.appdomain.cloud";
```

That's an IBM Cloud Code Engine instance the maintainer runs and updates manually. **The deploy process for that Code Engine instance is undocumented** — there is no CI workflow, script, or doc anywhere in this repo that automates or even describes pushing a new image to it (verified: no `.github/workflows/*.yml` references `simulator`; no repo doc mentions "Code Engine"). Treat this as a known gap, not something to reverse-engineer or invent a process for — if you need to update the live docs-site simulator backend, that requires the maintainer's out-of-band IBM Cloud access.

**Zero automated tests.** `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.coverage.run]` `source` is scoped to `custom_components.area_occupancy` only, and no file under `tests/` references `simulator/`. `simulator/app.py` (~1000 lines) has no test coverage at all — changes to it are unverified by CI beyond `ruff` linting.

Verified: `simulator/app.py` lines 1–45 (imports, `bayesian_probability` import, `sys.path` insertion), lines 448–1000+ (route/function definitions); `simulator/README.md` (full file — local-dev steps, stale `requirements.txt` reference, Docker/IBM Cloud section, "How It Works" section naming `bayesian_probability()`); `main.py` (repo root, full file); `simulator/Dockerfile`, `simulator/docker-compose.yml` (PORT=10000 default); `docs/docs/assets/simulator/app.js` lines 1–10 (hardcoded URL); `grep -rln "simulator" .github/workflows/` → no matches; `grep -rln "Code Engine\|codeengine"` across `*.md`/`*.yml` → no matches; `pyproject.toml` `[tool.coverage.run]` lines ~94–98; git blame on `def sigmoid_probability` → commit `a90f77b` "Add sigmoid-based occupancy detection framework (#353)".

---

## 7. Releases

**`gh release list` / `gh release view <tag>` is the changelog of record** — read it before assuming a fix isn't shipped. Releases use CalVer `YYYY.M.N` (e.g. `2026.5.17`), **not** the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` semver CLAUDE.md's "Branch and Release Strategy" section claims — that section is stale on this point (verified: `gh release list --limit 8` shows `2026.5.17, 2026.5.2, 2026.5.1, 2026.4.1, 2026.3.4, ...`, clearly calendar-versioned, not semver). Release bodies are hand-edited on top of GitHub's auto-generated "What's Changed" PR list — expect prose explaining the *why*, tables for structured changes (e.g. purpose→threshold mappings), and links back to originating issues.

**CLAUDE.md's `dev → preview → main` release-branch flow is also stale.** `git ls-remote --heads origin` currently shows only `main`, `gh-pages`, and feature/fix/chore/dependabot branches — no `dev`, `preview`, or `rc` branch exists on the remote. Spot-checking the 10 most recently merged PRs (#489 down to #452) shows all but one (#456, merged into the then-active `feat/adjacent-areas` branch) targeted `main` directly. The historical `dev`/`preview`/`rc` pipeline was real practice through roughly January 2026 and was abandoned in favor of direct feature-branch → `main` PRs some time after. One stale artifact remains: `.github/workflows/lint.yml` still lists `rc`/`dev` in its `pull_request.branches` trigger even though those branches no longer exist — harmless (the trigger just never fires for those bases), but don't use it as evidence the branches are still real.

**Version bump:** three files must change together (`manifest.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `const.py::DEVICE_SW_VERSION`). The versioning *policy* — the full three-file table, the CalVer scheme, and the `DEVICE_SW_VERSION`-vs-`CONF_VERSION` distinction — is owned by `aod-change-control` §4; consult it before any bump. Operationally: edit all three to the identical `YYYY.M.N` string, merge, then create the GitHub release with the tag exactly equal to `manifest.json`'s version (release.yml hard-fails otherwise, next paragraph).

**HACS distribution:** `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on `release: types: [published]`. It hard-fails (`::error::` + exit 1) if `manifest.json`'s `version` doesn't exactly equal the release tag, then zips `custom_components/area_occupancy/` (excluding `__pycache__`/`*.pyc`) into `area_occupancy.zip` and uploads it via `gh release upload "$TAG" area_occupancy.zip --clobber`. `hacs.json` sets `"zip_release": true` and `"filename": "area_occupancy.zip"` to match — HACS installs users on the uploaded zip, not a raw source checkout. Note `hacs.json` declares minimum HA version `2024.8.0`, nearly 1.5 years older than the `homeassistant==2026.2.2` pin actually used for local dev/CI testing — HACS will let a user on a much older HA install this integration.

**`.github/workflows/validate.yml`** ("Validate") runs two independent jobs — `hassfest` (`home-assistant/actions/hassfest@master`) and `hacs` (`hacs/action@main`, `category: integration`) — on `workflow_dispatch`, a **daily cron (`0 0 * * *`)**, push to `main`, and PRs targeting `main`/`rc`/`dev`. Both actions are pinned to floating refs (`@master`/`@main`), so a break in either upstream action can fail this workflow without any change in this repo. The `hacs` job specifically has a known transient-failure mode: it validates the presence of a local brand icon by calling out to `https://brands.home-assistant.io/domains.json`, and an upstream Cloudflare 525 there crashes the job with an uncaught `aiohttp.client_exceptions.ContentTypeError` — a repo-external flake, not a real validation failure, if you see that exact traceback.

Verified: `gh release list --limit 8`; `gh release view 2026.5.17 --json body`; `git ls-remote --heads origin`; `gh pr list --state merged --limit 10 --json number,baseRefName`; `.github/workflows/lint.yml` lines 3–11; `.github/workflows/release.yml` (full file); `.github/workflows/validate.yml` (full file); `hacs.json` (full file); `custom_components/area_occupancy/manifest.json:20`; `pyproject.toml:7`; `custom_components/area_occupancy/const.py:32-34`.

---

## 8. Docs deploy workflow

`.github/workflows/docs.yml` ("Build and Deploy Docs") triggers **only on push to `main`** (not PRs, not a cron). It checks out, configures git as `github-actions[bot]`, installs `uv` (`astral-sh/setup-uv@v7`), restores a `mkdocs-material-<ISO week>` cache, runs `uv sync --package area-occupancy-docs` (working directory `./docs`), then `uv run mkdocs gh-deploy --force` (also `./docs`) with `NO_MKDOCS_2_WARNING=1` set — deploying to the `gh-pages` branch. `permissions: contents: write`.

The docs stack is deliberately pinned: `mkdocs>=1.6.0,<2.0.0` and `mkdocs-material>=9.5.0,<10.0.0`, because MkDocs 2.0 is incompatible with Material for MkDocs and Material itself entered maintenance mode (per `docs/MIGRATION.md`, which sets an explicit 2026-08 revisit date for a possible move to the "Zensical" successor).

Verified: `.github/workflows/docs.yml` (full file); `docs/MIGRATION.md`.
