# Configuration

Area Occupancy Detection is configured entirely through the Home Assistant user interface.

## Adding a New Area

1.  **Navigate to Integrations:** Go to **Configuration** -> **Devices & Services** -> **Integrations**.
2.  **Add Integration:** Click the **+ Add Integration** button in the bottom right.
3.  **Search:** Search for "Area Occupancy Detection" and select it.
4.  **Configure Area Name:**
    - Enter a descriptive **Name** for the area this instance will monitor (e.g., "Living Room", "Office"). This name will be used in entity IDs.

## Configuration Options

### Area Purpose

The first step after naming the area is choosing its **purpose**. This sets a sensible default for the decay half life used when probability decreases. The purpose selection affects how quickly the system "forgets" about occupancy after activity stops.

| Purpose                | Description                                                                                                                                                                           | Default Half-Life |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Passageway**         | Quick walk-through: halls, stair landings, entry vestibules. Motion evidence should disappear almost immediately after the last footstep.                                             | 60 seconds        |
| **Utility**            | Laundry room, pantry, boot room. Short functional visits (grab the detergent, put on shoes) with little lingering.                                                                    | 120 seconds       |
| **Food-Prep**          | Kitchen work zone around the hob or countertop. Residents step away to the fridge or sink and return; a few minutes of memory prevents flicker.                                       | 300 seconds       |
| **Eating**             | Dining table, breakfast bar. Family members usually stay seated 10-20 minutes but may be fairly still between bites.                                                                  | 600 seconds       |
| **Working / Studying** | Home office, homework desk. Long seated sessions with occasional trips for coffee or printer; ten-minute half-life avoids premature "vacant".                                         | 600 seconds       |
| **Social**             | Living room, play zone, game area. Conversations or board games create sporadic motion; evidence fades gently to ride out quiet pauses.                                               | 720 seconds       |
| **Relaxing**           | TV lounge, reading nook, music corner. People can remain very still while watching or reading; a quarter-hour memory keeps the room "occupied" through stretches of calm.             | 900 seconds       |
| **Sleeping**           | Bedrooms, nap pods. Motion is scarce; a long half-life prevents false vacancy during deep sleep yet lets the house revert to "empty" within a couple of hours after everyone gets up. | 1800 seconds      |

You can override the resulting half life in the parameters section if needed.

After providing the name and purpose, you'll be guided through selecting sensors and configuring parameters. You can also reconfigure these later by clicking **Configure** on the integration card.

### Sensor Selection

You will be prompted to select entities for various categories. You only need to select sensors relevant to the specific area you are configuring.

## Reconfiguring an Existing Area

1.  Go to **Configuration** -> **Devices & Services** -> **Integrations**.
2.  Find the Area Occupancy Detection integration card for the area you want to change.
3.  Click **Configure**.
4.  You can then step through and modify any of the sensor selections, parameters, or weights.

Click **Submit** on each step to save changes.

## Automatic Learning

The integration automatically:

- Analyzes historical data to determine sensor reliability
- Calculates correlation between sensor states and occupancy
- Adjusts probabilities based on learned patterns
- Updates calculations in real-time

## Created Entities

After configuration, the integration creates:

1. **Occupancy Probability Sensor** – Shows the calculated probability as a percentage.
2. **Occupancy Status Binary Sensor** – Indicates if the area is occupied based on the threshold.
3. **Prior Probability Sensor** – Displays the combined prior used for calculations.
4. **Evidence Sensor** – Lists entities providing evidence and those that are inactive.
5. **Decay Status Sensor** – Indicates progress of probability decay.
6. **Occupancy Threshold Number** – Allows adjusting the threshold used by the binary sensor.
7. **Wasp in Box Sensor** – Virtual sensor combining motion and door data (if enabled).

## Adjusting Configuration

You can adjust settings anytime through the integration options:

1. Go to Settings → Devices & Services
2. Find Area Occupancy Detection
3. Click "Configure"
4. Modify settings as needed

## Next Steps

After configuration:

1. Monitor the created entities to ensure they reflect actual occupancy
2. Adjust the threshold if needed
3. Review the [Basic Usage](basic-usage.md) guide
