# Area Occupancy Detection

Welcome to the Area Occupancy Detection integration documentation. This integration provides intelligent room occupancy detection by combining multiple sensor inputs using Bayesian probability calculations.

## Overview

The Area Occupancy Detection integration enhances traditional motion-based occupancy detection by:

1. **Combining Multiple Data Sources**

      - Motion and occupancy sensors
      - Media device states
      - Appliance usage
      - Environmental sensors
      - Door and window states
      - Light states

2. **Using Bayesian Probability**

      - Calculates occupancy probability based on sensor states
      - Learns from historical data
      - Adapts to your living patterns
      - Provides confidence levels for occupancy detection

3. **Smart Features**

      - Time-based decay of probability
      - Historical analysis for improved accuracy
      - Configurable weights for different sensor types
      - Real-time threshold adjustments

## Quick Start

1. Install the integration through HACS or manually
2. Configure at least one motion sensor
3. Add additional sensors to improve accuracy
4. Adjust weights and thresholds as needed
