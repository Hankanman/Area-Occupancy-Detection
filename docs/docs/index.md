# Area Occupancy Detection

Welcome to the Area Occupancy Detection integration documentation. This integration provides intelligent room occupancy detection by combining multiple sensor inputs using Bayesian probability calculations.

## Overview

The Area Occupancy Detection integration enhances traditional motion-based occupancy detection by:

1. **Combining Multiple Data Sources**

      - Motion and occupancy sensors
      - Media device states
      - Appliance usage
      - Environmental sensors
      - Door and window states
      - Light states

2. **Using Bayesian Probability**

      - Calculates occupancy probability based on sensor states
      - Learns from historical data
      - Adapts to your living patterns
      - Provides confidence levels for occupancy detection

3. **Smart Features**

      - Time-based decay of probability
      - Historical analysis for improved accuracy
      - Configurable weights for different sensor types
      - Real-time threshold adjustments

## How it Works


Here's how the Area Occupancy sensor figures out if someone is in the room:

Think of the Area Occupancy sensor as a detective trying to figure out if someone's in a room based on various clues (your sensors).

1.  **Sensor Clues:** It constantly watches the sensors you've told it about (motion detectors, door sensors, lights, media players, etc.).
2.  **Adding Up Evidence:** When a sensor becomes "active" (like motion is detected, a door opens, or music starts playing), it increases the "chance of occupancy" score.
    *   **Weights Matter:** You tell the sensor how important each *type* of clue is by setting "weights". Motion sensors usually have a high weight, while a light turning on might have a lower weight.
3.  **Learning from the Past (The Smart Part):**
    *   The sensor looks back at history (e.g. the last week â€“ you configure how long).
    *   It pays close attention to your "Primary Sensor" (usually the main motion sensor you trust most).
    *   It learns patterns: "How often was the *light* on when the *primary motion sensor* also saw movement?" or "How often was the *media player* playing when the *primary motion sensor* saw no movement?"
    *   This helps it figure out which sensors are *actually* good indicators of occupancy *in that specific room*. A sensor that's often active even when the room is empty won't be trusted as much over time. This learning happens automatically in the background (usually hourly).
4.  **The "Decay" Feature (Preventing Flickering):**
    *   When *all* sensors become inactive, the chance of occupancy doesn't drop to zero immediately.
    *   Instead, it slowly fades or "decays" over a time window you set (e.g., 5 minutes/300 seconds).
    *   This is helpful so the sensor doesn't think the room is empty just because you sat perfectly still for 30 seconds.
5.  **The Threshold:**
    *   You set a "Threshold" percentage (e.g. 50%).
    *   The sensor compares its final calculated "chance of occupancy" score (after considering all clues, learning, and decay) to this threshold.
    *   If the score is above the threshold, the main Occupancy Sensor turns ON. If it's below, it turns OFF.

**In short:** It combines real-time sensor activity (weighted by importance) with learned historical patterns to make an educated guess about occupancy, using a decay feature to smooth things out and a threshold to make the final occupied/unoccupied decision.
