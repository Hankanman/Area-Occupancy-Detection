# Machine Learning Requirements (Universal)

## Overview

Machine learning (ML) models are used to enhance occupancy detection by learning complex patterns from all available sensor data, not just environmental sensors. ML is a universal feature and should be considered for any sensor type where sufficient data is available.

## Core ML Components

### ML Model Manager
```python
# custom_components/area_occupancy/ml_models.py
```
- Model training and validation for all sensor types (environmental, binary, numeric, etc.)
- Feature engineering for all available data
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Performance monitoring and drift detection
- Model persistence and versioning

### Training Pipeline
```python
class OccupancyMLModel:
    """Machine learning model for occupancy analysis."""
    
    async def train_model(
        self, 
        training_data: list[EnvironmentalData],
        occupancy_labels: list[bool]
    ) -> None:
        """Train the ML model with historical data."""
        
    async def predict_occupancy(
        self, 
        current_data: dict[str, EnvironmentalData]
    ) -> EnvironmentalAnalysisResult:
        """Predict occupancy probability from current environmental data."""
        
    async def evaluate_model(self) -> dict[str, float]:
        """Evaluate model performance metrics."""
        
    async def update_model(self, new_data: list[EnvironmentalData]) -> bool:
        """Incrementally update model with new data."""
```
- Should be generalized to support all sensor types, not just environmental
- Handles data preparation, training, validation, and inference

### Feature Engineering
- Temporal features (time of day, day of week, etc.)
- Sensor-specific features (raw values, deltas, rates of change)
- Cross-sensor features (correlations, combined states)

### Model Architecture
- **Primary Model**: Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM) or similar
- **Alternative Models**: Other ML models as appropriate for the data

### Configuration Integration
- ML enable/disable option in config flow
- Training data requirements and thresholds
- Model performance settings (confidence threshold, update interval, etc.)
- Analysis method selection (ML/Deterministic/Hybrid)

### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Historical data collection for all sensor types
- Data quality validation
- Training data preparation and caching
- Data cleanup and retention policies

### Real-time Inference
- ML model inference used in real-time probability calculations when enabled and sufficient data is available
- Fallback to deterministic analysis if ML is not available or not confident

### Error Handling
- Validate input data and model outputs
- Handle missing or invalid data gracefully
- Log model training and inference steps at debug level
- Provide fallback values and recovery mechanisms

### Testing Requirements
- Test model training with various data sizes
- Verify prediction accuracy and confidence
- Test model serialization and loading
- Validate incremental learning
- Test model performance monitoring
- Verify feature importance calculation
- Test overfitting prevention
